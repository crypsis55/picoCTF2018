Q1. Forensics Warmup 1. Can you unzip this file for me and retreive the flag?
download from link --> https://2018shell.picoctf.com/static/2fa508658d91918514dadf3ff331b8f6/flag.zip
unzip with winzip, 7zip or windows
open flag.jpg --> read picoCTF{welcome_to_forensics}

Q2. Forensics Warmup 2. Hmm for some reason I can't open this PNG? Any ideas?
download flag.png --> https://2018shell.picoctf.com/static/032d65124629e45f0b5151aad4e7b5b1/flag.png
thumbnail shows its a picture similar to Q1 I would guess this was supposed to be more difficult
open in multi-format picture viewer --> read flag picoCTF{extensions_are_a_lie}

Q3. General Warm-up 1. If I told you your grade was 0x41 in hexadecimal, what would it be in ASCII?
find a hexadecimal to ASCII converter https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html
input hexadecimal [0x41] output ASCII [A]
picoCTF{A}

Q4. General Warm-up 2. Can you convert the number 27 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?
find a decimal to binary converter https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/index.html
input decimal [27] output binary [11011]
picoCTF[11011]

Q5. General Warm-up 3. What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?
find a hexadecimal to decimal converter
input hexadecimal [0x3D] output decimal [61]
picoCTF{61}

Q6. Resources. We put together a bunch of resources to help you out on our website! If you go over there, you might 
even find a flag! https://picoctf.com/resources (link)follow link browse page --> answer near the bottom

Q7. Reversing Warm-up 1. Throughout your journey you will have to run many programs. Can you navigate to /problems/reversing-warmup-1_2_a237211c4be8902c67102f827027e633 on the shell server and run this program to retreive the flag?

Q8. Reversing Warm-up 2. Can you decode the following string dGg0dF93NHNfczFtcEwz from base64 format to ASCII?
google decrypt base64 to ASCII https://www.base64decode.org/
paste in the string [dGg0dF93NHNfczFtcEwz]
decode --> th4t_w4s_s1mpL3
picoCTF{th4t_w4s_s1mpL3}

Q9. Crypto Warm-up 1. Crpyto can often be done by hand, here's a message you got from a friend, llkjmlmpadkkc with the 
key of thisisalilkey. Can you use this table to solve it?
google decrypt message with key and table --> https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher
input cyphertext [llkjmlmpadkkc] input key [thisisalilkey] output decrypted [secretmessage]
picoCTF{SECRETMESSAGE} hint: use caps

Q10. Crypto Warm-up 2. Cryptography doesn't have to be complicated, have you ever heard of something called rot13? cvpbPGS{guvf_vf_pelcgb!}
google rot13 decrypt https://www.rot13.com/
input string [cvpbPGS{guvf_vf_pelcgb!}] output [picoCTF{this_is_crypto!}]

Q11. grep 1. Can you find the flag in file? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. You can also find the file in /problems/grep-1_3_8d9cff3d178c231ab735dfef3267a1c2 on the shell server.
cd /problems/grep-1_3_8d9cff3d178c231ab735dfef3267a1c2

Q13. HEEEEEEERE'S Johnny! Okay, so we found some important looking files on a linux computer. Maybe they can be used to get a password to the process. Connect with nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 35225. Files can be found here: passwd shadow.
hint: If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. And again. And again.
If you're not careful these kind of problems can really "rockyou".
pretty much telling you to use John the ripper and the rockyou word-list to crack the shadow file password

cd /problems/grep-2_0_783d3e2c8ea2ebd3799ca6a5d28fc742/files
iterate through folders files0-9

Major General John M. Schofield's graduation address to the graduating class of 1879 at West Point is as follo
ws: The discipline which makes the soldiers of a free country reliable in battle is not to be gained by harsh 
or tyrannical treatment.On the contrary, such treatment is far more likely to destroy than to make an army.It 
is possible to impart instruction and give commands in such a manner and such a tone of voice as to inspire in
 the soldier no feeling butan intense desire to obey, while the opposite manner and tone of voice cannot fail 
to excite strong resentment and a desire to disobey.The one mode or other of dealing with subordinates springs
 from a corresponding spirit in the breast of the commander.He who feels the respect which is due to others, c
annot fail to inspire in them respect for himself, while he who feels,and hence manifests disrespect towards o
thers, especially his subordinates, cannot fail to inspire hatred against himself.
